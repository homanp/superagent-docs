### Agents

An agent is a program or system that is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks.
In the context of SuperAgent, an agent is a Large Language Model that has access to a suite of tools and can decide which tool to use based on user input.

There are two main types of agents: action agents and plan-and-execute agents.
Action agents decide on an action to take and take that action one step at a time, while plan-and-execute agents first decide on a plan of actions to take and then execute those actions one at a time.

An agent can be invoked with `memory` as well as a `document` which gives the Agent the possibility to remember previous messages and do Question/Answering.

### Documents

SuperAgent allows users to do question answering over documents by attaching a `Document` to an `Agent`.
Documents are files, such as PDF, TXT, images, Markdown etc. that can be ingested by passing a publicly available `URL` to the SuperAgent [API](/api-reference/authentication).
SuperAgent splits these documents into smaller chunks and stores them in a vector database for use downstream.

This approach has some downsides when working with tabular data. We are looking into how to best approach this problem.
